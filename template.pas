  number, holder - integer variables
  GuestNumber, RoomNumber - CamelCase for variables with multiple words
  RNumber, RArea - Prefix R for Real Numbers
  PI, GRAVITY - Constants are written with capitals only.
  Single instruction in each line.
  `begin` and `end` are also single in each line
  In handwritten code, underscore key words like `var`, `begin`, `end` etc.
  Code between `begin` and `end` is 2 or 4 spaces indented. The words`begin` and `end`
  words them selves are not indented.
  Instructions after control structs like `if` and `else` are also indented.
  After long blocks of code the keyword `end` should be followed 
  by a comment describing the begin of block.
